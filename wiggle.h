 * When a conflict occurs we need to treat some surrounding
 * sections as being involved in that conflict.  For
 * line-based merging, all surrounding sections until an Unchanged
 * section are part of the conflict - the Unchanged isn't.
 * For word-based merging, we need to find Unchanged sections
 * that include a newline.  Further, text within the unchanged
 * section upto the newline (in whichever direction) is treated
 * as part of the whole conflict.
 * Actually... it is possibly for a 'Changed' section to bound
 * a conflict as it indicates a successful match of A and B.
 * For line-wise merges, any Changed or Unchanged section bounds a conflict
 * For word-wise merges, any Changed or Unchanged section that matches
 * a newline, or immediately follows a newline (in all files) can bound
 * a conflict.
